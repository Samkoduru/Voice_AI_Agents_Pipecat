## üöÄ Quick Start

Each project is independent and can be run separately. For a guided setup, use the included setup script in each directory:

### MedFlow (Patient Intake)
```bash
cd MedFlow
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python src/config/medflow_setup.py
# Follow the instructions to configure your .env and run the server
python medflow.py
```

### VoiceFlow (Voice Assistant)
```bash
cd VoiceFlow
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python src/config/voiceflow_setup.py
# Follow the instructions to configure your .env and run the server
python voiceflow.py
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- OpenAI API Key
- Deepgram API Key (for VoiceFlow)
- Cartesia API Key
- Twilio Account (for VoiceFlow)
- Daily.co Account (for MedFlow)

## üîß Configuration

Each project has its own configuration and setup script:
- **MedFlow:** Uses Daily.co for real-time communication and patient intake
- **VoiceFlow:** Uses Twilio for phone integration and real-time AI conversations
